# OCR-Using Matlab
## INTRODUCTION

❏ The presentation presents introduction, objectives, Literature review and Methodology that we used in our project - Optical Character Recognition . 

❏ OCR is generally an "offline" process, which analyzes a static document. Handwriting movement analysis can be used as input to handwriting recognition.

❏ OCR has enabled scanned documents to become more than just image files, turning into fully searchable documents with text content recognized by computers.
